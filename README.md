Wiki Gear Page: https://www.srcf.ucam.org/caving/wiki/Gear
Please see http://caving.soc.srcf.net/ for other files. This repo is cloned there under http://caving.soc.srcf.net/Documents/Gear/.

Please use CSVs folder for current working lists and the Docs folder for documents (for instance 
a tackle store inventory as of a particular date).

For compatability, all new files must be:
- Plain Text
- CSV
- PDF

All files outside of this format will be removed (within reason).
