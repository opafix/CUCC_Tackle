# CUCC_Tackle
Repo for storing files for the Cambridge University Caving Club

Please use CSVs folder for current working lists and the Docs folder for documents (for instance 
a tackle store inventory as of a particular date).

For compatability, all files must be:
- Plain Text
- CSV
- PDF

All files outside of this format will be removed (within reason).
