From Wookey, 05/2018:
	I ended up with some stuff left in the van after training weekend.

	List of gear I have:
	1 small warmbac tacklesack
	7 slings
	1 rope protector
	1 bolting hammer
	1 setter
	6 maillions
	10 ring hangers

	I also have the drill, 3 chargers and all the batts.

	Hope that helps you make a more accurate list :-)
